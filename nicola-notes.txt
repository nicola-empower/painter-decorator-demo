This is **Chroma Decor**.

The video highlights a very specific, high-value differentiator: **"100% Dust Free"**.

To sell this site for top dollar, you aren't selling "painting"; you are selling **"Property Enhancement"** and **"Kitchen Transformations."**
The painter who buys this site wants to stop painting rental magnolia walls for £150 a day and start spraying bespoke kitchens for £3,000 a week.

### The Persona: "The Interior Finish Specialist"
* **Tone:** Meticulous, clean, artistic, and respectful.
* **The Pitch:** We treat your home like a showroom. No dust, no mess, just a factory-perfect finish.
* **Target Audience:** Homeowners in Newcastle/Gateshead with heritage properties or expensive furniture who are terrified of mess.

Here is the homepage copy for **Chroma Decor**.

### 2. Services Section (The Money Makers)
*We need to highlight the skills that justify high rates: Spraying and Wallpapering.*

**Headline:**
**Interior & Exterior Excellence**

* **Kitchen & Furniture Spraying:**
    Don't replace your kitchen—revitalize it. Our airless spray painting creates a durable, factory-smooth finish on cabinets and joinery for a fraction of the cost of a refit.

    From hand-printed papers to wide-width vinyls. We meticulously pattern-match and hang high-end wallcoverings with invisible seams.
* **Period Restoration:**
    Respecting the past. We specialize in breathable paints for lime plaster, sash window restoration, and heritage colour matching.

### 3. The "Quote Assistant" (The Star Feature)
*The video shows a fantastic multi-step form. You must sell this hard. It turns a "painter" into a "modern business."*

**Headline:**
**Plan Your Project in 2 Minutes**

**Body:**
Avoid the back-and-forth. Tell us about your space—whether it’s a single room, kitchen cabinets, or the full property—and get a detailed estimate fast.

**How this sells your web package:**
* Tell the painter: *"This tool asks the questions you usually ask on the phone. By the time you get the email, you know if they need 'Kitchen Cabinets' or 'Plastering Repair'. It filters out the time-wasters automatically."*

### 4. The "Process" Section (Reassurance)
*Decorating is invasive. Clients worry about their furniture. This section calms them down.*

**Headline:**
**A Stress-Free Transformation**

* **1. Meticulous Prep:** We protect your floors and furniture before we open a single can of paint.
* **2. Dustless Sanding:** Our Festool extraction units capture 99.9% of dust at the source. No mess in your lungs or on your sofa.
* **3. The Finish:** Two coats of premium trade paint (Farrow & Ball, Little Greene, or Dulux Heritage) applied for depth of color.
* **4. The Reveal:** We clean, vacuum, and put the furniture back. All you do is enjoy the new look.

### 5. Testimonials (The "Clean Freak" Client)
*The reviews in the video are great; let's polish them slightly.*

**Headline:**
**Flawless Results, Zero Mess**

> **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "My kitchen looks brand new."**

### **Strategy Check:**
By focusing on **"Dust-Free"** and **"Kitchen Spraying,"** we move this client out of the "commodity" market and into the "specialist" market.
